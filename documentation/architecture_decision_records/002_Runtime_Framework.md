# Runtime Framework

## Context
A runtime framework is needed, to be able so serve Webservices for the UI. It should be easy to use and lightweight.

The most prominent frameworks are

* Spring Boot
* Quarkus
* Micronaut

## Decision
In my opinion Quarkus provides the best documentation and support for developers. This list provides the features why I voted for quarkus:

* easy getting started
* easy upgrade
* best documentation
* easy support for image builds
* native image build support
* fast startups
* developer mode(live coding, developer ui, ...)
* easy configuration
* dev services
* currently I am most familiar with quarkus

## Consequences

### Positive Impact
Fast development because less time is needed to work with/learn the framework.

### Possible Drawbacks
The release cycles are short. Upgrades are more often necessary.
