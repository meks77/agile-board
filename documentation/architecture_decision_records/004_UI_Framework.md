# UI Framework

## Context
A UI Framework is needed.

Current list of candidates
* angular
* next.js
* remix
* react
* vue.js
* vaadin
* spring MVC

## Decision

### not vaadin

I didn't find an easy possibility to drag Cards between columns on the board. I am afraid that it can be complicated

### not spring mvc

it doesn't support ui components. I need drag & drop for cards between the columns. But spring is not a single page
application.
Furthermor the resources needed to deploy the application(RAM) is in my opinion unnecessary.

### not vue.js

It's a java script famework. I am not familar with javascript. It would be a burden to learn javascript to be able to
deliver good uis.

### not react

React is a library for creating components. It's not a ui framework.

### angular

I am not a specialist for Web UIs. I'm afraid that beside of JSF I am most familar with angular. But all my experience
is what I learned in 2 days.
That's not a lot experience :(.

## Consequences

Hard work to get familar with angular.

### Positive Impact

I will get more familar with angular.

### Possible Drawbacks

Maybe some things will not work as I'd like it to work. E.g. Drag & Drop
